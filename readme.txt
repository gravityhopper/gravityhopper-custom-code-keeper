== Description ==

= How does it work? =

PHP Code Keeper for Gravity Forms‚Ä¶

- creates a directory at `wp-content/uploads/gravity_hopper/code/`.
- adds a file `gf-global-code.php` *(for housing globally run code)*.
- optionally creates/duplicates/deletes a `gf-00xx.php` file for every form created/duplicated/deleted. *(for housing form-specific code)*
- will load all files in the code directory associated with an existing form or having prefix that has been explicitly allowed.
- allows exporting any number of code files to compressed .zip.
- introduces pages in the Gravity Forms interface whereby you can manage custom PHP code.

**Code Keeper does not restrict when specific files are included on the site. All code from allowed files residing in the `gravity_hopper/code/` directory will run for all forms. Always use appropriate hooks and/or conditional checks when targeting specific forms and fields.**

= Why use it? =

PHP Code Keeper provides orderliness to your code customizations, gives you a better sense of the specific code running across your site, and helps ensure your customizations are not lost when other site modifications are made.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does PHP Code Keeper load custom code per form? =

No. This plugin is intended for code wrangling only and does not restrict when code is run. AAll code from allowed files residing in the `gravity_hopper/code/` directory will run for all forms. Always use appropriate hooks and/or conditional checks when targeting specific forms and fields.

= Can I edit the custom code from within my WordPress dashboard? =

Yes! Create, edit, and delete files via **Forms ‚Üí Code** and **Form ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Code Keep**

= How are files loaded? =

Allowed files within the directory `gravity_hopper/code/` of your uploads directory will be loaded.

The file `gf-global-code.php` will always be loaded and will be loaded before other files.

Any files matching prefix patterns allowed via the filter `gravityhopper-cck/allowed_file_prefixes` will be loaded in the order they appear in that filtered array.

Finally, any form-specific files named using the convention `gform-00xx.php` will be loaded next, provided a form matching the ID exists on the site.
